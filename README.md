# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:

To design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study.

## Algorithm:

a. Apply Gestalt principles to enhance mobile and web layout design.
b. Incorporate UI elements and design patterns into the layouts.
c. Develop interaction behaviors and usability principles for the designs.
d. Create a brand logo using Canva, following styling and branding guidelines and include it with your layouts. 

## Output:

### I. Gestalt principles to enhance mobile and web layout design :

Grouping:
All related elements are grouped logically to improve readability.
For example, Menu Items with Prices, Combo Meals with Images, and Customer Reviews with Ratings are placed together in their respective sections.
This ensures smooth visual scanning and helps users make quick dining decisions.

Similarity:
All major Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons such as Order Now, Book a Table, and View Menu share the same color scheme, rounded edges, and hover/active effects.
Consistent styling reinforces the Soulplate brand identity and creates a professional, unified interface.

Flow:
The layout follows a clear, natural sequence to enhance user engagement:
→ Hero Banner (introducing the restaurant with Korean cuisine visuals)
→ Signature Dishes & Combos (best-selling meals)
→ Special Offers / Chef’s Picks (highlighted dishes or seasonal items)
→ Final Action (Order Online / Reserve a Table / Subscribe).

This structured flow keeps users engaged from entry to action.


### II. UI elements and design patterns into the layouts : 
Web Layout

Hero Section:
A wide, high-quality image of Korean dishes—such as bibimbap, kimchi, or tteokbokki—forms the centerpiece of the page.
The Soulplate logo appears prominently at the top-left, while the restaurant tagline (e.g., “Taste the Soul of Korea”) overlays the banner for branding impact.

Navigation:
A horizontal navigation bar provides quick access to essential pages: Home, Menu, Specials, Order Online, About Us, and Contact.
The Order Now button is highlighted using the brand’s accent color for high visibility.

Content Display:
The menu and dishes are displayed in a grid layout (3-column) with food images, short descriptions, prices, and “Add to Cart” or “Book Now” buttons.
Each dish card includes star ratings and icons for spice level or vegetarian options.

### Mobile Layout :

Navigation:
A hamburger menu (≡) is used for compact navigation, giving users quick access to Menu, Offers, Cart, and Reservation pages.

Content Display:
Meals are presented in scrollable cards, each showing the dish image, name, price, and order button—optimized for easy thumb reach and mobile readability.

Quick Actions:
A floating “Order Now” button remains visible as users scroll, allowing quick checkout or table booking with a single tap.


### III. Interaction behaviors and usability principles for the designs :

Interaction:
Interactive elements such as buttons and food cards respond to user actions.
When hovered or tapped, they slightly scale up or show a subtle shadow effect, providing tactile feedback and liveliness.

Consistency:
The interface maintains a warm, earthy color palette—inspired by Korean culture—using tones like deep red, beige, and charcoal gray.
Typography is consistent throughout: a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Poppins or Noto Sans KR) is used for headings, and a clean readable style for descriptions.

Ease of Use:
Essential actions such as Order Now, Reserve Table, and Subscribe are placed both at the top and bottom for easy access and improved navigation flow.


### IV. The Logo :

Recognition:
The Soulplate logo features elegant typography with subtle Korean cultural influence—clean lines and minimal design representing sophistication and authenticity.
The name “Soulplate” reflects both the soulful flavor of Korean cuisine and the art of plating—a blend of emotion and presentation.
